WP OWM Weather is a flexible and easy to use weather plugin that allows you to create unlimited different weathers using Custom Post Types and Open Weather Map API. 

Create a weather, select your city, choose the options and customize the look in a few clicks.

Embed it anywhere with the shortcode automatically generated by copy and paste in posts, pages, text widgets, or directly in the PHP files of your theme.

With Custom Post Types, you minimize maintenance: change some settings to automatically change all weather posts with the same shortcode instantly.

<h4>For developers</h4>
Templating system: The main advantage is that you can create a completely personalized weather without changing the core of the plugin. In addition, your changes will not be overwritten at each plugin update.

* Go to WP OWM Weather template directory: http://yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-owm-weather/template/
* Copy content-wpowmweather-custom1.php and content-wpowmweather-custom2.php files.
* Go to your theme directory: http://yoursite.com/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/
* Create a new folder called wp-owm-weather (the spelling is important).
* In this new folder, paste content-wpowmweather-custom1.php and content-wpowmweather-custom2.php files.
* Now, open content-wpowmweather-custom1.php or content-wpowmweather-custom2.php with a php editor like notepad ++, coda2, sublime text…
* Write your weather layout.. You can use the other templates as guidelines.
* Save and send your changes via FTP.
* Now you built a custom weather template. Select the template "Custom 1" or "Custom 2" in your weather settings.

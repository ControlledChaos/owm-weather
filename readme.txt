WP Cloudy 2 is a powerful weather plugin for WordPress, based on Open Weather Map API, using Custom Post Types and shortcodes, and much more.

== Description ==

<strong>After more than 5 years of loyal service, the original WP Cloudy will no longer be maintained. The wpcloudy.com site will remain accessible for documentation only. Thank you !</strong>

<strong>This is now WP Cloudy 2. It will convert any original WP Cloudy settings and weather pages.</strong>
<hr>

WP Cloudy 2 is a flexible and easy to use weather plugin that allows you to create unlimited different weathers using Custom Post Types and Open Weather Map API. 

Create a weather, select your city, choose the options and customize the look in a few clicks.

Embed it anywhere with the shortcode automatically generated by copy and paste in posts, pages, text widgets, or directly in the PHP files of your theme.

With Custom Post Types, you minimize maintenance: change some settings to automatically change all weather posts with the same shortcode instantly.
